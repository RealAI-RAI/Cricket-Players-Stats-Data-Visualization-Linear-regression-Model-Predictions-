# Cricket Players' Stats Data Visualization & prediction of player's Performance 

This is a project that visualizes the performance statistics of top cricket players using Python libraries. The data used in this project is obtained from Cricinfo Statsguru.

# Data


The data set used in this project contains the statistics of the top 5 batsmen in Test cricket, as of September 2021. The data includes the following fields:

Player: name of the player
Span: span of the player's career
Mat: number of matches played
Inns: number of innings batted
NO: number of times not out
Runs: total number of runs scored
HS: highest score in a single innings
Ave: average number of runs per dismissal
BF: number of balls faced
SR: strike rate (runs per 100 balls)
100: number of centuries scored
50: number of half centuries scored
0: number of times the player was dismissed without scoring
4s: number of fours scored
6s: number of sixes scored

# Libraries used

The following Python libraries were used in this project:

pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
matplotlib: for data visualization using line charts and scatter plots
seaborn: for data visualization using heatmaps and bar charts
plotly.express: for data visualization using heatmaps and bar charts

# Visualizations

The following visualizations were created using the data set:

A line chart showing the total number of runs scored by each player over the course of their career.
A scatter plot showing the relationship between the average number of runs scored per dismissal and the strike rate.
A heatmap showing the frequency distribution of the number of centuries and half centuries scored by each player.
A bar chart showing the total number of fours and sixes scored by each player.
Running the code
To run the code, you will need to have Python 3 and the required libraries installed on your machine. You can install the required libraries using the following command:
